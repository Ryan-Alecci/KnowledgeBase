Profiling is enable in the deployment menu > click the node > general settings > Policy Service > Enable profiling service
	Profiling probes are enable the the same area except choose Profiling Configuration instead of general settings.
		Too many probes to cover in detail. Cisco recommends, in order, RADIUS, AD, DHCP, DNS, NMAP
			HTTP Probe is useful in a guest setting to gather data from browsers when they are redirected to ISE.
		
profiling notes
- Custom conditions only. Adding attributes in the profile wont work due to EndPoint Attribute Filter in profiling settings.
- Create a profile and assign it to a logical profile for smaller auth list in policy sets.
- Use DNS probe to veryify DNS server has info on the devices
- On the NAD use "mab request format attribute 32 vlan access-vlan" this shares the VLAN of MAB devices in the RADIUS messages.
- Parent policies are policies an ednpoint must hit prior to being classified/moved to the associate profile.
	Create new profile. Select "No, use existing Identity Group hierarchy" & Select a parent policy.
	That parent policy must have conditions that the new endpoint can hit before it will change to the associated one.



Example of parent policies:
Parent profile = Approved_devices
- Use DNS/AD conditions to findout if its existed or joined to the network


Actual Profile = Linux-Workstations
- Parent policy = Aproved_devices
-- It must hit parent policy first before it considers the Linux-Workstation profile
--- Condition, is NAS-Identifier = 100

Order of operations
Device hits Approved_Devices (Has a FQDN or AD entry)
Profling moves onto check profiles that have Approved_devices as the parent
Profling sees other attributes (eg.NAS-Identifier = 100) and chooses the profile with the highest certainty factor it matches
